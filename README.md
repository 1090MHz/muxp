# Mesh Updater X-Plane (MUXP)
This program allows to update the mesh files (.dsf-files) for X-Plane 11. 

## WARNING - Early Development Stage
This program is in an early development stage and still has some errors. For the moment only use it in case you know what you are doing. In any case you do everything on your own risk.

Refer https://github.com/nofaceinbook/muxp/blob/master/LIMITATIONS.md for current limitations of that early version and https://github.com/nofaceinbook/muxp/issues for known issues.

## Highlights

* Option to **change the mesh and thus elevation** for the area e.g. for your airport and **share these changes with others** without the need to share complete dsf files which are large, might have copyright issues and change only your area (e.g. not if there are changes required for another airport.

* **Better flatten airports** only where needed (not a hughe area as done by the X-Plane flatten flag)

* Generate **runway profiles** exactly as they are.

* You can also change the elevation of **raster squares**.

* **See how the mesh really looks like** via .kml files that can e.g. be visualized with Google Earth

* Also **update the elevation layers for networks/roads** to e.g. generate bridges.

## How does MUXP work

Muxp adapts the dsf-files of X-Plane including the mesh information. For the adaption the scenery developer creates a muxp file (yaml text file) including deintions for the mesh like flattening of a certain area.
