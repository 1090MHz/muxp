MESH UPDATER X-PLANE (MUXP)
==========================
by schmax 2021

This software updates your mesh for X-Plane 11.

This executable version runs at the moment only under Windows.
Mac/Linux users can download Python source code here: https://github.com/nofaceinbook/muxp/releases/latest
There you can also download the newest update of this program and report errors.

IMPORTANT: This is still a version under development and might have errors. Everything you do is at your own risk. 


INSTALLATION OF MUXP
----------------------------------
For installation unzip this full folder in your X-Plane Custom Scenery Folder.


UPDATING YOUR MESH
---------------------------------
Updating your Mesh is very simple. Just drop in Windows File Explorer the wanted
MUXP file on muxp.exe. MUXP will then automatically update according X-Plane mesh files. 
Alternatively you can also run muxp.exe via double click and then select the MUXP file from GUI. 
Use the sample files to get started:  https://github.com/nofaceinbook/muxp/releases/latest/download/Muxp-Sample-Files.zip
The README file in this folder gives you more information about what changes are performed by each MUXP file.


ACTIVATION OF UPDATED MESH IN X-PLANE
-------------------------------------------------------------
MUXP is pre-configured to activate updated mesh in your scenery_packs.ini file so that after
start/re-start of X-Plane it becomes visible. Just click "OK" when asked for such an activation.
If you prefer to configure your scenery_packs.ini file on your own, press CANCEL when asked
and you could also change this config in MUXP GUI. Note that mesh dsf files have lowest
priorities (at bottom of file) and that there can only be one mesh defined per tile. The mesh with
highest priority is shown in X-Plane.


MANUAL
-----------
To get a better understanding of how MUXP works and how you could create your own 
MUXP file refer to the Manual that can be downloaded at:
https://github.com/nofaceinbook/muxp/releases/latest/download/MUXP-Manual.pdf


UNINSTALL
---------------
MUXP does not change any Windows settings. You just need to uninstall this program and 
all mesh updates are not wanted any more. Refer to the manual for more details.
