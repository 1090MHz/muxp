# Current Limitations of MUXP
The program ist in its early development and has thus currently several limitations.

* **Limited tools for generating muxp files:** For the moment you could creat .muxp files only with text editor or with some work in Google Earth. In future it is planned that muxp offers function to e.g. generate a runway profil based on the airport defintion apt.dat or uses drawn kml polygons in WED to flatten an area.

* **No autmatic removal of flatten flag:** If you adapt e.g. the elevation of parts of an airport and the airport has in the apt.dat the flatten flag set you have to remove this line manually in order to see the changes. 

* **No tooled management of muxp files:** For the moment you have to disable/de-install muxp changes manually. Also to make several changes for one tile is currently not directly possible from muxp.

* **No automated zipping of updated dsf files:** The updated dsf files are not zipped automatically. Meaning that they will be larger than original files and consuming more space on your drive. However you can manually 7zip them in arhcives for them moment.

* **Missing documentation:** There is up to now no full documentation. Check the files her in GitHub or at https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/209905-upating-mesh-with-muxp-a-first-example/
